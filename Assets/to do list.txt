NOTE:	These things aren't necessarily planned to be done in this particular order.
	The reason they are numbered are to see how many things are left to do.

		Price APIs, have a user choice which Price API to use
			YGOPRODeck has prices for these:
				Cardmarket
				TCGPlayer
				Coolstuffinc
				Ebay
				Amazon

			My choices
				Cardmarket for EU
				TCGPlayer for NA?


					Minimum API requests: Send a request to get all cards. For each card, check its name,
					if file exist, replace data with new Json encrypted card info.






REPORT TO YGOPRODECK ADMIN!: Draitron Eclipse doesn't have any card_set information, randomcard endpoint doesn't return an id for card image
Windwitch - Diamond Bell have no card_set info. Trackblack, Grain Corn Token, The Melting Red Shadow, Soul Token, Dark Soul Token, Armed Dragon Blitz, "Rainbow Dragon, the Zenith Crystal Beast".
Dwell Chair Gear has the name "Dwell Chair Gear\r\n" in the database, messing up filesaving.


Why does the info from the randomcard endpoint differ from the cardinfo endpoint??

What does the card_sets.set_price go after? TCGplayer? Is it a cached number? If it is, how outdated is it?
Is the lowest price cached? If it is, how outdated is it?







IMPLEMENT THE FULL API PING!!!!!! (if for nothing else, to be able to properly save all card data)
Add misc??



ARTWORK BUTTONS DOESN'T GET SET TO ACTIVE, AND THUS DOESN'T SHOW BUTTONS!!!!!!!


COLOR CODING IN PARAMETER STOPPED WORKING!!!!!!!!! FIX!!!!
